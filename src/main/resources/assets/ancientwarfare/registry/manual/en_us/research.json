The Info button directly next to this slot will open up the Research Book. \nNext, click on the “Research Queue” button directly the right of the book will open up a menu where you can add Researches to the queue. You can add as many Researches to this queue as you like, and as you add Researches, other Researches will begin to appear. \nOnce you have your Researches queued, hit the ESC key to return to the Research Station menu, and you can see the items necessary to complete the first research in the queue is displayed in the “Needed” grid. Place the items into the “Input” grid to begin research, which should begin as soon as all the minimum item amounts are placed into the grid. Progress on the Research will be displayed by a green progress bar. The items do not need to be placed in the same exact orientation has the “Needed” grid. \nThe lower inventory space is simply for storing extra items, while the “Adj Inv” checkbox enables using an adjacent inventory, such as a chest, to input items directly to the “Input” grid. The two buttons directly below the progress bar are used to determine the position of the Adjacent Inventory. The left button can be changed to the four cardinal directions and Up and Down, which tell the Research Station where to look for the Adjacent Inventory. The right button should be left alone, except in special circumstances. "
