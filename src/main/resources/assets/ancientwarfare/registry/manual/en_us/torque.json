            "text": "Ancient Warfare has its own power system, known as Torque, to allow Ancient Warfare to have a fully stand-alone power system, while remaining compatible with other power systems such as RF and BuildCraft-MJ. Torque is based off the real life physics principle of Torque and the power that entails. This means it is also affected by friction, and every Torque tile will incur loss of Torque due to it. Torque is compatible with most other FE systems. Torque is converted in a 1:1 ratio with BuildCraft-MJ, and Torque can be inputted into any MJ consuming machines, but cannot be inputted into any MJ transfer blocks. MJ can be inputted into Torque consuming machines and transferring blocks. \n RF is converted into Torque at a 10:1 ratio, and works as if it were a native connection, i.e, full input and output connectivity. This should work on any RF enabled mod."
