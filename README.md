## Development

In order to develop on this project you will need to:  

1) Download the repository into a local folder.  

2) Locate this folder, run `gradlew setupDecompWorkspace` (or `./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace`). This sets up base minecraft and minecraftforge libraries and their dependencies.

3) Run `gradlew idea` or `gradlew eclipse` based on the IDE you use to setup project files.

At this point it should be completely setup to begin development.
